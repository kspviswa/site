This blog is dedicated to share my developer rumblings on software engineering, debugging techniques, software frameworks, puzzles & hardcore software development

## My Background
I have 15+ years of experience in Telecom / Datacom / Networking Industry. I grew from humble beginnings of a software developer to a senior product manager but all along carried my developer origins and couldn't stay away too much from terminal.

I'm here to get the eternal bliss of being a humble developer
