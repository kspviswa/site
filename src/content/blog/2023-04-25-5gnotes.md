## AMF => Access & Mobility Function

* AMF <-> gNodeB via N2 interface
* AMF <-> UE via N1 interface
	* AMF is the MME equivalent as in LTE, but in LTE there is direct interface between MME and UE
	* N1 is happening via gNodeB but gNodeB acts as transparent proxy for N1
* AMF <-> SMF for session management
* AMF <-> LMF for location management
* AMF <-> PCF for policy enforcement
* AMF <-> AUSF/UDF for Authentication & Subscriber management
	*  AMF acts as a relay between xNF and UE for all session related signalling
		* xNF -> AMF -> gNodeB -> UE
* Incase of 5G NSA (Non Stand Alone) and interworking with EPC, AMF connects to MME for sharing of user contexts incase UE moves between 5GC and EPC
	* Less signalling and no need for reauthentication
